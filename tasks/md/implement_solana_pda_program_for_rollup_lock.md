description = "Implement a local file-based storage mechanism for the `rollup.lock` data, crucial for the Super Fast Resolution System and compile caching. This component will be responsible for reading, writing, and managing the global state on the file system."
steps = [
    "Implement functions to read the `rollup.lock` file from disk into memory.",
    "Implement functions to write the in-memory `rollup.lock` data structure back to disk.",
    "Ensure atomic updates to the `rollup.lock` file to prevent data corruption (e.g., by writing to a temporary file and then renaming).",
    "Consider mechanisms for locking the `rollup.lock` file during writes to prevent concurrent access issues."
